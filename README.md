# mPING
Scripts reading mPING and NCEI SED data, used for academic purposes.

The script began by taking advantage of the NSSL and OU API access for the mPING database.  I further used this for a final project for a GIS class, and further implemented NCEI Storm Events Database data.  This may grow into a capstone project to culminate my graduate work.  In the meantime, the script can be used to query mPING data.  You just need to acquire your own API key through the mPING website.  Note, this data CANNOT be used for monetary gain.
